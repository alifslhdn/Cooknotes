1. Project title: COOKNOTES
==========================================================
2. Description:

a. Motivation:

In this increasingly digital world, all information is available at our fingertips. This includes when looking for a recipe to cook a meal. All recipes can be found in our smartphone. But sometimes when we make a dish, there are definitely extra spices or cooking techniques that may not be available on the internet and make us write it somewhere either in a book or on the phone. And sometimes when we want to refer to the recipe in the book or the note in the phone, we cannot find it. This gives us problems and slows down the process of preparing food because it takes a long time to find the recipe.

b. Goal:
- Easy to refer to stored recipes
- Save money and time

c. Target Users:
- Houswife
- Single person who is not living with family
- Chefs

d. What Cooknotes can do: 

- It is able to store user information such as user profile
- It is able to store user’s notes on cooking such as recipes, instructions, ingredients etc.
- It allows user to create, read, update or delete their cooking notes according to the given template
- It has register, login, logout and setting features
- It allows the user to view articles that are posted by the chefs related to cooking tips and recipes.
- It allows chefs to create, read, update or delete their article according to the given template

e. What CookNotes cannot do:

- It does not have network feature like adding friends or viewing other user’s profile
- It does not have gamification like reward and points system
- It cannot store notes other than cooking type
- It disallows any random user to post any article. The chefs will be selected by the admin outside of the application.
